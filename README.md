# Spotify Downloader

Added a rate limit on request of @lemonbarfromlucida now the app only send 10 download req per min

First make spotify app and get client id and client secret<br>
then run aria2c (i made a simple shell script to run it)
then start the app it will first download all songs in ur playlist and then watch for update if u add more songs it will download them


Very bad code i just quickly assembed it also used chat gpt cuz i am lazy and dont wanna explod my brain with spotify api


If it works it works if it dont work you are always welcome to open PR and i will merge


I dont have much time so dont extpect anything

things are hard coded, idk what to do I am lazy.


Also this is for educational and research purpose i dont take any responsiblity.
